# Express Controller Framework
A simple controller Framework that augments express.

## Description

This is a controller framework that adds the ability to use controller classes with express with dependency injection
of services.
To see how to use it look into the [sample](https://github.com/PanJoh/node-express-ctrl/blob/master/src/samples/sample.ts)
At the moment it is not production ready but there are plans get it.

## Roadmap
- Add middleware classes which can contribute in dependency injection
- Add error handling classes which can contribute in dependency injection
- Add validators to controllers and controller methods.
